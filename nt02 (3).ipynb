      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘THAT you won’t’ thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied\n",
      "\n",
      "she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\n",
      "\n",
      "hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,\n",
      "\n",
      "but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\n",
      "\n",
      "from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\n",

      "cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "all!’ ‘Do as I tell you, you coward!’ and at last she spread out her\n",
      "\n",
      "hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were\n",
      "\n",
      "TWO little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. ‘What a number of\n",
      "\n",
      "cucumber-frames there must be!’ thought Alice. ‘I wonder what they’ll do\n",

      "next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I’m\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices\n",
      "\n",
      "all talking together: she made out the words: ‘Where’s the other\n",
      "\n",
      "ladder?--Why, I hadn’t to bring but one; Bill’s got the other--Bill!\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,\n",
      "\n",
      "saying to herself ‘This is Bill,’ she gave one sharp kick, and waited to\n",

      "see what would happen next.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing she heard was a general chorus of ‘There goes Bill!’\n",

      "\n",
      "silence, and then another confusion of voices--‘Hold up his head--Brandy\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "wonder what they WILL do next! If they had any sense, they’d take the\n",
      "\n",
      "roof off.’ After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘A barrowful of WHAT?’ thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,\n",

      "window, and some of them hit her in the face. ‘I’ll put a stop to this,’\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her\n",
      "\n",
      "head. ‘If I eat one of these cakes,’ she thought, ‘it’s sure to make\n",
      "\n",
      "SOME change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it must\n",

      "make me smaller, I suppose.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\n",
      "\n",
      "began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through\n",
      "\n",
      "the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little\n",
      "\n",
      "animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was\n",
      "\n",
      "in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\n",
      "\n",
      "something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\n",
      "\n",
      "appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\n",
      "\n",
      "safe in a thick wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The first thing I’ve got to do,’ said Alice to herself, as she wandered\n",

      "about in the wood, ‘is to grow to my right size again; and the second\n",
      "\n",
      "thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be\n",
      "\n",
      "the best plan.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\n",
      "\n",
      "arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\n",

      "how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among\n",

      "the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\n",
      "\n",
      "feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. ‘Poor little thing!’\n",
      "\n",
      "said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but\n",
      "\n",
      "she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be\n",
      "\n",
      "hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of\n",

      "all her coaxing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\n",

      "held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\n",
      "\n",
      "all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\n",
      "\n",
      "and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,\n",
      "\n",
      "to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\n",
      "\n",
      "other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\n",

      "over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was\n",
      "\n",
      "very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,\n",
      "\n",
      "rather shyly, ‘I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--at least I know\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth\n",
      "\n",
      "and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the\n",
      "\n",
      "mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,\n",
      "\n",
      "‘One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you\n",

      "grow shorter.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Of the mushroom,’ said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly\n",
      "\n",
      "round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she\n",
      "\n",
      "stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit\n",
      "\n",
      "of the edge with each hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And now which is which?’ she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\n",
      "\n",
      "the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent\n",
      "\n",
      "blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt\n",
      "\n",
      "that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she\n",
      "\n",
      "set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed\n",
      "\n",
      "so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her\n",
      "\n",
      "mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the\n",

      "\n",
      "changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders\n",
      "\n",
      "were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was\n",
      "\n",
      "an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a\n",

      "neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had\n",
      "\n",
      "just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going\n",
      "\n",
      "to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops\n",
      "\n",
      "of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made\n",
      "\n",
      "her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and\n",

      "was beating her violently with its wings.\n",

      "the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little\n",

      "animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was\n",
      "\n",
      "in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\n",

      "something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\n",

      "\n",

      "how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among\n",

      "the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\n",

      "to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\n",

      "\n",
      "very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\n",

      "all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\n",

      "\n",
      "cheerfully as she could. ‘At any rate I’d better be getting out of the\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Do you see THAT?’ he said, in a voice choking with passion, and\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "thinking that he was frightened: ‘only an old rattle--quite old and\n",

      "\n",

      "tear his hair. ‘It’s spoilt, of course!’ Here he looked at Tweedledee,\n",
      "\n",
      "who immediately sat down on the ground, and tried to hide himself under\n",

      "the umbrella.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice laid her hand upon his arm, and said in a soothing tone, ‘You\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "All this time Tweedledee was trying his best to fold up the umbrella,\n",
      "\n",
      "with himself in it: which was such an extraordinary thing to do, that it\n",
      "\n",
      "quite took off Alice’s attention from the angry brother. But he couldn’t\n",
      "\n",
      "quite succeed, and it ended in his rolling over, bundled up in the\n",
      "\n",
      "umbrella, with only his head out: and there he lay, opening and shutting\n",
      "\n",
      "his mouth and his large eyes--‘looking more like a fish than anything\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "in a minute with their arms full of things--such as bolsters, blankets,\n",
      "\n",
      "hearth-rugs, table-cloths, dish-covers and coal-scuttles. ‘I hope you’re\n",

      "than anything else, by the time they’re ready!’ she said to herself, as\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Do I look very pale?’ said Tweedledum, coming up to have his helmet\n",

      "like a saucepan.)\n",

      "under the chin, and, in spite of a series of little shrieks of ‘Oh, oh,\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘She can’t do Subtraction,’ said the White Queen. ‘Can you do Division?\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I suppose--’ Alice was beginning, but the Red Queen answered for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Bread-and-butter, of course. Try another Subtraction sum. Take a bone\n",

      "from a dog: what remains?’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "talking!’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘She can’t do sums a BIT!’ the Queens said together, with great\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Can YOU do sums?’ Alice said, turning suddenly on the White Queen, for\n",

      "she didn’t like being found fault with so much.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "‘So do I,’ the White Queen whispered: ‘we’ll often say it over together,\n",
      "\n",
      "dear. And I’ll tell you a secret--I can read words of one letter! Isn’t\n",
      "\n",
      "THAT grand! However, don’t be discouraged. You’ll come to it in time.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the Red Queen began again. ‘Can you answer useful questions?’ she\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Where do you pick the flower?’ the White Queen asked. ‘In a garden, or\n",

      "in the hedges?’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, it isn’t PICKED at all,’ Alice explained: ‘it’s GROUND--’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘How many acres of ground?’ said the White Queen. ‘You mustn’t leave out\n",
      "\n",
      "so many things.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Fan her head!’ the Red Queen anxiously interrupted. ‘She’ll be feverish\n",
      "\n",
      "after so much thinking.’ So they set to work and fanned her with bunches\n",
      "\n",
      "of leaves, till she had to beg them to leave off, it blew her hair about\n",
      "\n",
      "so.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘She’s all right again now,’ said the Red Queen. ‘Do you know Languages?\n",

      "What’s the French for fiddle-de-dee?’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Fiddle-de-dee’s not English,’ Alice replied gravely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Who ever said it was?’ said the Red Queen.\n",
      "\n",

      "Alice thought she saw a way out of the difficulty this time. ‘If you’ll\n",

      "\n",
      "it!’ she exclaimed triumphantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Red Queen drew herself up rather stiffly, and said ‘Queens never\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I wish Queens never asked questions,’ Alice thought to herself.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Don’t let us quarrel,’ the White Queen said in an anxious tone. ‘What\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The cause of lightning,’ Alice said very decidedly, for she felt quite\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Which reminds me--’ the White Queen said, looking down and nervously\n",
      "\n",
      "clasping and unclasping her hands, ‘we had SUCH a thunderstorm last\n",
      "\n",
      "Tuesday--I mean one of the last set of Tuesdays, you know.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was puzzled. ‘In OUR country,’ she remarked, ‘there’s only one day\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Red Queen said, ‘That’s a poor thin way of doing things. Now HERE,\n",
      "\n",
      "we mostly have days and nights two or three at a time, and sometimes\n",
      "\n",
      "in the winter we take as many as five nights together--for warmth, you\n",

      "know.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Are five nights warmer than one night, then?’ Alice ventured to ask.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Five times as warm, of course.’\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Just so!’ cried the Red Queen. ‘Five times as warm, AND five times\n",
      "\n",
      "as cold--just as I’m five times as rich as you are, AND five times as\n",
      "\n",
      "clever!’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Humpty Dumpty saw it too,’ the White Queen went on in a low voice, more\n",

      "pleased she’ll be!’ But this was more than Alice had courage to do.\n",

      "\n",
      "eagerly that, when the two great heads vanished from her lap, she hardly\n",
